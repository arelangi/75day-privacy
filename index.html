    <h1>Privacy Policy for 75 Day</h1>
    <p class="last-updated"><strong>Last Updated: December 30, 2025</strong></p>

    <h2>Our Commitment to Your Privacy</h2>
    <p>75 Day is designed with privacy as a core principle. We believe your personal data should remain yours.</p>

    <h2>Data Collection</h2>
    <p><strong>We collect ZERO data.</strong></p>
    <ul>
        <li>No personal information</li>
        <li>No usage analytics</li>
        <li>No tracking pixels</li>
        <li>No third-party analytics services</li>
        <li>No advertising networks</li>
        <li>No crash reporting services</li>
    </ul>

    <h2>Data Storage</h2>
    <p>All your data is stored locally on your device:</p>
    <ul>
        <li>Daily task completion records</li>
        <li>Progress photos</li>
        <li>Streak information</li>
        <li>Challenge start date</li>
    </ul>
    <p><strong>None of this data ever leaves your device</strong> unless you explicitly choose to share it using the app's share features.</p>

    <h2>Progress Photos</h2>
    <p>Your progress photos are stored in the app's private storage on your device. They are NOT saved to your Photos library automatically. They are NOT uploaded to any server. They remain completely private unless you choose to share them.</p>

    <h2>Notifications</h2>
    <p>The app requests permission to send you local notifications (reminders). These notifications are generated locally on your device. No notification data is sent to any external service.</p>

    <h2>Data Sharing</h2>
    <p>We never share your data with anyone because we never have access to it. If you use the app's share features (sharing progress images, certificates, etc.), you control what is shared and where.</p>

    <h2>Third-Party Services</h2>
    <p>This app does not use any third-party services, analytics, or advertising networks.</p>

    <h2>Children's Privacy</h2>
    <p>The app does not knowingly collect any data from anyone, including children under 13.</p>

    <h2>Changes to This Policy</h2>
    <p>We may update this privacy policy from time to time. Any changes will be posted on this page with an updated "Last Updated" date.</p>

    <h2>Contact</h2>
    <p>If you have any questions about this privacy policy, please contact: <strong>arelangi@gmail.com</strong></p>

    <h2>Your Rights</h2>
    <p>Since we don't collect any data, there's nothing for us to delete, modify, or export. All your data remains on your device and you have complete control over it.</p>
